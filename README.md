# SMS OTP Server

## Overview

This project is a simple SMS OTP (One-Time Password) server that has been successfully implemented. It allows for the generation and verification of OTPs. Below are the details of this project:

## Functionality

The OTP server has the following features:

- **OTP Generation**: It can generate OTPs, each 6 characters in length.

- **OTP Verification**: It provides the capability to verify OTPs.

## Implementation Details

- **RESTful API**: The OTP server has been designed as a RESTful API, allowing clients to make HTTP requests to generate and verify OTPs.

- **Technology Stack**: The server was built using Ruby on Rails, a robust and reliable framework.

## Key Considerations

Although this is a minimalistic implementation, several key considerations were made:

- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests have been created to ensure the server's reliability and functionality.

- **OTP Expiry**: To enhance security, an expiry date has been implemented for generated OTPs. They are only valid for a specific duration.

## Out of Scope

The following elements were deemed out of scope for this implementation:

- **Actual SMS Delivery**: The primary focus here is OTP generation and verification. SMS delivery has not been integrated.

- **Authentication for the API**: While authentication is crucial in a production environment, this project primarily concentrates on OTP functionality.

## Collaboration Tools

The project was efficiently developed using integrated development environments (IDEs) for coding. Collaborative efforts were streamlined by screen sharing during development.

Additionally, tools like [JamBoard](https://jam.new) were used for whiteboarding when necessary.

## Completion Time

The entire project, from conception to testing, has been successfully completed within the recommended time frame of 1 hour.

Please note that this implementation serves as a valuable showcase of the ability to create a functional OTP server within a limited time frame.

Feel free to explore and test the functionality of this OTP server. Your feedback is welcome!
